What Did I Learn Throughout the Process?
Exploring the Data:

I discovered that the conservation status "Species of Concern" dominates the dataset, while statuses like "Endangered" and "In Recovery" are relatively rare.
Working through the data revealed how the dominance of Vascular Plants in the dataset influences overall patterns, requiring normalization to better understand risks for smaller categories like Mammals and Birds.
Modeling and Statistical Testing:

Through predictive modeling, I learned how features like "Species of Concern" play the most significant role in predicting endangered status, while low-importance features like "Reptiles" can add noise to models.
Statistical testing (Chi-Square) confirmed that the relationship between species categories and conservation statuses is significant, providing a strong foundation for conservation-focused insights.
Visualization and Insights:

Visualizing the data provided critical insights into which species categories (Mammals, Birds, and Fish) are most at risk, and which parks host the most observed species.
Are the Results What I Expected?
Expected Results:
I anticipated that Mammals and Birds might be heavily represented in higher-risk categories due to ecological pressures and habitat destruction. These findings aligned with my expectations.
Unexpected Results:
I did not expect Vascular Plants to overwhelmingly dominate the "No Status" category, raising questions about whether their conservation is underreported or less critical in current frameworks.
The high proportion of Fish in the "Threatened" category was also surprising, leading to further curiosity about potential factors like pollution or habitat loss.
Key Findings and Takeaways:
Conservation Risks:

Mammals and Fish show the highest risks of being endangered, making them a priority for conservation efforts.
Birds, though not heavily endangered, dominate the "Species of Concern" category, highlighting the need for preemptive monitoring.
Ecological Patterns:

Observations in national parks reflect the adaptability and ecological dominance of species like pigeons and Yorkshire fog grass.
Data Insights:

Normalizing the dataset provided a clearer picture of relative risks, revealing how smaller categories like Amphibians and Fish face significant threats.
Actionable Recommendations:

Conservation efforts should prioritize Mammals, Fish, and Birds based on their higher-risk or pre-risk statuses.
Further research is needed to understand why Vascular Plants dominate "No Status" and if their risks are under-assessed.
